Gaza Recovery Through Low-Tech Circular Economy

This repository documents an independent UN-style proposal focused on Gaza early recovery, combining war rubble recycling and marine plastic recovery into a single, crisis-adapted system.

Key Concepts

Low-technology, low-water recovery hubs

Community-based rubble recycling

Marine plastic collection without washing or shredding

Food-linked, in-kind incentive mechanisms

Non-cash humanitarian value exchange

Why Gaza needs a different model

Gaza’s reconstruction context is defined by:

Absence of functional cement kilns

Severe freshwater scarcity

Energy and mobility constraints

High inflation risk

This proposal avoids industrial assumptions and instead uses manual, mobile, and decentralized systems.
